        "## About the data\n",
        "This data set `airbnb.csv` comes from the Airbnb website and describes about 300 Airbnb listings in the Salem, Oregon area. The data describes many aspects of the listings including information about the hosts, listing description, and amenities offered at the facilities.\n",

        "## Analysis\n",
        "The goal of this analysis is to determine which amenities are the most common and which are the least common in the Salem, Oregon area. However, because the amenities are stored as lists in a single column of the data set, this information is difficult to analyze without the use of for loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will use nested for loops to count up how many of each amenity exists in Airbnb listings in Salem, Oregon."
